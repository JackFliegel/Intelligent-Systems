Python version 3.11.1 or later

All of my code for problem 1 and 2 can be run just by running the python file run.py.
    "python run run.py"

It is assumed the data files located in folder 'HW4_datafiles/'

The code sequentially goes through each part of the problem listed out in the main function and completed with a function call.
Once program has started, give it a few moments to train the data set. Progress can be tracked within terminal.
Exit out of all tables and plots to continue running the program.
The program will finish after the last plot is closed.
